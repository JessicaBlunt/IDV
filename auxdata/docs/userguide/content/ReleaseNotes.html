<faqitem q="Grid 3D Trajectories" id="g3trajectory">
  <p>
    The new grid 3D trajectory is based on the VisAD library enhancements. The
    Grid 3D trajectory includes 3D Grid Trajectory, 3D Grid
    Trajectory colored by speed, and Trajectory colored by another parameter. By default, the initial area of 3D
    trajectory is the whole domain of the dataset, and the user could choose one of the option: points,
    closed polygon, and rectangle to setup the initial area.
